# Alexander's dotfiles

Dotfiles are how you personalize your system. It contains the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine. These are mine. 

Fore more info about dotfiles read: https://dotfiles.github.io/

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the install.sh script. The install script will pull in the latest version and copy the dotfile to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexander-svendsen/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh
```

To update, run the last command again inside your `dotfiles` repository:

```bash
source install.sh
```
